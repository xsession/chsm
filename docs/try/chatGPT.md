How to write hierarchical state machine in python?
A hierarchical state machine (HSM) is a type of finite state machine (FSM) that allows for the construction of complex behaviors by combining the behaviors of multiple, simpler FSMs. In this way, an HSM can be thought of as a tree of FSMs, where the root node represents the overall behavior of the system and the child nodes represent the behaviors of the individual components.

To implement an HSM in Python, you will need to define a class that represents the state machine and its states. You can do this using a class hierarchy, with a base State class that defines the interface for all states, and subclasses that define the behavior of individual states.

Here is an example of how you might define a simple HSM in Python:

Copy code
class State:
    def enter(self):
        pass

    def exit(self):
        pass

    def handle_event(self, event):
        pass

class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.current_state = initial_state
        self.current_state.enter()

    def handle_event(self, event):
        self.current_state.handle_event(event)

class StateA(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "EVENT_A":
            print("Handling event A in state A")
        elif event == "EVENT_B":
            print("Transitioning from state A to state B")
            self.exit()
            self.machine.current_state = StateB()
            self.machine.current_state.enter()

class StateB(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "EVENT_A":
            print("Transitioning from state B to state A")
            self.exit()
            self.machine.current_state = StateA()
            self.machine.current_state.enter()
        elif event == "EVENT_B":
            print("Handling event B in state B")

# Create a state machine with an initial state of A
machine = StateMachine(StateA())

# Send some events to the state machine
machine.handle_event("EVENT_A")
machine.handle_event("EVENT_B")
machine.handle_event("EVENT_A")
This simple HSM has two states, StateA and StateB, and two events, EVENT_A and EVENT_B. When the HSM is in StateA and it receives an EVENT_A event, it will handle the event and stay in the same state. If it receives an EVENT_B event, it will transition to StateB. When the HSM is in StateB and it receives an EVENT_A event, it will transition back to StateA. If it receives an EVENT_B event, it will handle the event and stay in the same state.

To create more complex behaviors, you can define additional states and events, and use the handle_event method to define transitions between states. You can also define an enter and exit method for each state to specify any behavior that should be performed when the state is entered or exited.

How to create package with multiple target in cmake?
In CMake, a "target" is a build artifact that represents a library or an executable. To create a package with multiple targets using CMake, you can follow these steps:

Create a CMakeLists.txt file in the root of your project directory. This file will contain the CMake commands that are used to build your project.

In the CMakeLists.txt file, use the add_library or add_executable command to define your targets. For example:

Copy code
add_library(mylib STATIC src/mylib.cpp)
add_executable(myapp src/main.cpp)
Use the target_link_libraries command to specify the dependencies for each target. For example:
Copy code
target_link_libraries(myapp mylib)
Use the install command to specify the location where the targets should be installed when running make install. For example:
Copy code
install(TARGETS mylib myapp
        ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
        RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)
Use the include command to include any additional CMake files that may be needed to build your project. For example:
Copy code
include(src/CMakeLists.txt)
Use the project command to specify the name and version of your project. For example:
Copy code
project(myproject VERSION 1.0.0)
Use the add_subdirectory command to include any subdirectories that contain additional CMake files. For example:
Copy code
add_subdirectory(src)
add_subdirectory(tests)
Once you have defined your targets and specified the dependencies and install locations, you can use CMake to generate build files for your project. You can then use these build files to build and install your targets.

For example, to generate Makefiles for a Unix-like system, you can run the following command:

Copy code
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
To build your targets, you can then run make. To install your targets, you can run make install.

For more information about using CMake to build and install projects, you can refer to the CMake documentation.

      this.machine.currentState.enter();
    } else if (event === "EVENT_B") {
      console.log("Handling event B in state B");

// Create a state machine with an initial state of A

Copy code
public abstract class State {
  public void enter() {}
  public void exit() {}
  public void handleEvent(String event) {}
}

public class StateMachine {
  private State currentState;

  public StateMachine(State initialState) {
    this.currentState = initialState;
    this.currentState.enter();
  }

  public void handleEvent(String event) {
    this.currentState.handleEvent(event);
  }
}

public class StateA extends State {
  @Override
  public void handleEvent(String event) {
    if (event.equals("EVENT_A")) {
      System.out.println("Handling event A in state A");
    } else if (event.equals("EVENT_B")) {
      System.out.println("Transitioning from state A to state B");
      this.exit();
      this.machine.currentState = new StateB();
      this.machine.currentState.enter();
    }
  }
}

public class StateB extends State {
  @Override
  public void handleEvent(String event) {
    if (event.equals("EVENT_A")) {
      System.out.println("Transitioning from state B to state A");
      this.exit();
      this.machine.currentState = new StateA();
      this.machine.currentState.enter();
    } else if (event.equals("EVENT_B")) {
      System.out.println("Handling event B in state B");
    }
  }
}

// Create a state machine with an initial state of A
StateMachine machine = new StateMachine(new StateA());

// Send some events to the state machine
machine.handleEvent("EVENT_A");
machine.handleEvent("EVENT_B");
machine.handleEvent("EVENT_A");
This simple HSM has two states, StateA and StateB, and two events, EVENT_A and EVENT_B. When the HSM is in StateA and it receives an EVENT_A event, it will handle the event and stay in the same state. If it receives an EVENT_B event, it will transition to StateB. When the HSM is in StateB and it receives an EVENT_A event, it will transition back to StateA. If it receives an EVENT_B event, it will handle the event and stay in the same state.

How to write hierarchical state machine in vhdl?
A hierarchical state machine (HSM) is a type of finite state machine (FSM) that allows for the construction of complex behaviors by combining the behaviors of multiple, simpler FSMs. In this way, an HSM can be thought of as a tree of FSMs, where the root node represents the overall behavior of the system and the child nodes represent the behaviors of the individual components.

To implement an HSM in VHDL, you will need to define a module that represents the state machine and its states. You can do this using a state machine architecture, with a state signal that represents the current state of the machine and a next_state signal that represents the next state of the machine.

Here is an example of how you might define a simple HSM in VHDL:

Copy code
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity hsm is
  port (
    clk : in  std_logic;
    rst : in  std_logic;
    event_a : in  std_logic;
    event_b : in  std_logic;
    done : out std_logic
  );
end hsm;

architecture rtl of hsm is
  type state_type is (state_a, state_b);
  signal state, next_state : state_type;
begin
  process (clk)
  begin
    if (rst = '1') then
      state <= state_a;
    elsif (clk'event and clk = '1') then
      state <= next_state;
    end if;
  end process;

  process (state, event_a, event_b)
  begin
    case state is
      when state_a =>
        if (event_a = '1') then
          next_state <= state_a;
        elsif (event_b = '1') then
          next_state <= state_b;
        end if;

      when state_b =>
        if (event_a = '1') then
          next_state <= state_a;
        elsif (event_b = '1') then
          next_state <= state_b;
        end if;

      when others =>
        next_state <= state_a;
    end case;
  end process;

  done <= '1' when state = state_b else '0';
end rtl;
This simple HSM has two states, state_a and state_b, and two events, event_a and event_b. When the HSM is in state_a and it receives an event_a event, it will stay in the same state. If it receives an event_b event, it will transition to state_b. When the HSM is in state_b and it receives an event_a event, it will transition back to state_a. If it receives an event_b event, it will stay in the same state.

To create more complex behaviors, you can define additional states and events, and use the case statement in the process block to define transitions between states. You can also use the done output signal to specify any behavior that should be performed when the HSM is in a particular state.
